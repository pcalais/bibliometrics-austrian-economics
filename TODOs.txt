Which Human Action? A Micro-Level Citation Analysis of Mises’ Magnum Opus

Spanning 952 pages, 39 chapters, and 7 parts, Ludwig von Mises' Human Action (1949) is a cornerstone of Austrian economics. Yet, how its insights are engaged in scholarly literature remains largely unexplored. This study asks: How is Human Action cited? Which parts are most referenced, and in what context? To answer these questions, we analyzed a sample of 1,602 academic papers that directly cite Human Action. Through contextual citation analysis, we identified specific sections, direct quotes, page numbers, and co-cited authors, providing a detailed map of the book’s scholarly impact at the micro level — examining each sentence that cites a specific chapter of the book.

Our findings reveal that all 39 chapters are cited to varying degrees, underscoring the breadth and depth of their contributions. Parts 1 (Human Action) and 4 (Catallactics) account for 80% of references. By applying well-established statistical techniques, we identified three dominant citation patterns: papers that cite Human Action with an emphasis on praxeology and the action axiom, papers that focus on catallactics, and papers that engage broadly with the text's other parts.

Additionally, Human Action is co-cited (within the same sentence) alongside 582 authors, reflecting significant interaction with the broader literature. Frequently co-cited authors include Frank Knight, Max Weber, Milton Friedman, and Adam Smith, illustrating its interdisciplinary relevance and challenging perceptions of the Austrian School’s intellectual isolation. This study provides a detailed bibliometric analysis of Human Action and offers a framework for assessing the scholarly impact of foundational texts in Austrian economics and beyond.
